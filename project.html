      <p>The client wanted to create a cloud storage service and considered a wide variety of features from organizing content to sharing and collaborating with others. They needed guidance on what direction to take the project in to be competitive in the cloud storage space.</p>

        <p>Keep is a simple and easy-to-use cloud storage app with a focus on making sure your files are safe and organized. The goal of Keep is to simplify the process of organizing and backing up files, making it a worry-free process for the user.

    <!-- Competitive Analysis -->

      <div>
        <h2>Competitive analysis:</h2>
          <p>I created a SWOT analysis and researched brands that each have different specialities when it comes to cloud storage. Depending on which direction we went in, one of these brands would be a main competitor.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Google Drive not only provides file organization but allows users to create documents, spreadsheets and presentations while collaborating and sharing easily with others. It has a lot of competition with companies like Dropbox and also Microsoft Office.
            </li>
            <li>Evernote targets the specific need for organizing notes, lists, voice memos which other similar programs don’t focus on but this also limits its capabilities to a specific niche.
            </li>
            <li>Pinterest allows users to create different boards for organizing their content visually, while also acting as a bookmarking tool for saving links. Other social media apps are adding comparable features, which reduces the need for an additional bookmarking site.

          <h2>User Flow</h2>
        <div>
          The next step was to create user flows for these tasks which included creating an account, signing in, uploading a file, organizing a file and upgrading an account. I started with sketching multiple flows for each task before finalizing them with digital versions. This process helped me work out the simplest way for users to complete a task.

          <p>The lo-fi prototype was then used to conduct usability testing in-person and over video call. Users were asked to complete the tasks outlined in my user flows. Through these tests, I discovered some minor changes I needed to make for better usability such as making the file name clickable for viewing the file and making folder names highlight so the user can see when it is selected.

          <p>In-person usability testing with the mobile prototype shed light on several pain points for users.

The upgrade option was also difficult to find, so the upgrade account menu moved from the user avatar to the settings icon.

            This project started with a broad idea for a product and through user research and a competitive analysis, I determined what direction would be best for a new product to enter the cloud storage market. Surveys and user persona development helped determine the most important features to focus on.

            Through sketching, wireframing and usability testing I was able to identify problems and quickly make improvements. Preference tests and further usability testing with a hifi prototype allowed for feedback not only on functionality but also the branding and visual design. Taking into account the user feedback from all steps of this process allowed for the best possible product across mobile and desktop.
