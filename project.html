        <h3>Competitive analysis</h3>
          <p>I created a SWOT analysis and researched brands that each have different specialities when it comes to cloud storage. Depending on which direction we went in, one of these brands would be a main competitor.

          <h3>Preference Testing</h3>
            <p>When deciding on certain design elements, I created online preference tests using Usability Hub where I could gain feedback on the visual design. These tests provided insight into which design choices stood out the best visually and which ones the users preferred the most.

          <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
          <p>In-person usability testing with the mobile prototype shed light on several pain points for users. Users did not understand which part of the app they were currently in, so this changed from a filled icon to a highlight around the icon. The upgrade option was also difficult to find, so the upgrade account menu moved from the user avatar to the settings icon.

          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
              This project started with a broad idea for a product and through user research and a competitive analysis, I determined what direction would be best for a new product to enter the cloud storage market. Surveys and user persona development helped determine the most important features to focus on.
            </p>
            <p>
              Through sketching, wireframing and usability testing I was able to identify problems and quickly make improvements. Preference tests and further usability testing with a hifi prototype allowed for feedback not only on functionality but also the branding and visual design. Taking into account the user feedback from all steps of this process allowed for the best possible product across mobile and desktop.
