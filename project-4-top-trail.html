        <!-- Problem -->
        <div class="tt-problem text-padding">
          <h3>The Problem</h3>
          <p>
            Top Trail’s website currently requires users to use a third party app or device to track their trail rides before manually uploading to the site. The majority of users also access Top Trail primarily on their phone but they are frustrated with the mobile site.

        <div class="text-box tt-solution">
          <h3>The Solution</h3>
          <p>The Top Trail app provides GPS trail tracking so users can track, upload and compete all in one place. There will no longer be the need to export a GPS file from another app and manually upload them to the site. The app will also give users better functionality for accessing their Top Trail information on their phones.

          <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
          <p>
            I completed a SWOT analysis with two main competitors, Equitrail and Equilab. This analysis showed what the common features are for a horseback riding app and what features Top Trail would need to compete with them. It also showed me how there’s really not a lot of competition in this niche market.

            Equitrail has standard features for trail tracking but their branding and website is very out of date.

The process of pausing and stopping a ride was a bit confusing so I adjusted the buttons that users have while tracking a ride to make this simpler. I also made the decision to add an extra “Upgrade now” button, so users are easily reminded of upgrading when their trial expires.

            <p>Overall, the user testing went really well and almost all the users successfully completed the tasks. One major problem I saw was that users who were not familiar with Top Trail found the Challenges section confusing, which made me see the need to add more descriptive information here and change some of the labels on the challenges. I also found that I needed to adjust the wording for the Challenge sponsorship.
            </p>
            <p>Upgrading the account appeared to be more difficult for users to find this time around, showing that not everyone knew where to go to upgrade. Once they arrived at the Profile page though, everyone noticed the “Upgrade now” button right away. One solution idea I have is to create an “Upgrade” notice that appears on multiple pages when a user is due to upgrade.

            <h3>Conclusion and Next Steps</h3>
            <p>The founder and the current Top Trail users are very excited for this app. I found that the tracking capability and the ability to save trail ride details were most important to the users as this is where they are having the most frustrations with the current site.
            </p>
            <p>After my user testing, I added more functionality to the prototype including a Welcome Tour which shows the user around on their first login. I also added screens for the "Activity" section where users can view their friends' trail activity. The next step will be another round of user testing to test these features.</p>
