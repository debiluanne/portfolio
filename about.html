        <h3>My Story</h3>
          <p>Ever since I taught myself to build fan club websites in high school (fueled by my obsession with music) I have been designing something. The desire to customize my Myspace profile helped me learn basic HTML. I took photography and video classes where I learned how to use Adobe programs. When I started an Etsy shop for selling vintage clothing, I used my design skills to create a business logo and would design graphics or promotional materials for my shop.
          </p>
          <p>
          Almost every job I’ve had has involved some type of design despite being in very different industries. I did tech support over the phone for a software company where I helped improve people’s experiences when they had a technical issue. I designed email newsletters for a magazine publisher. I ran a retail business where I designed all marketing materials as well as the layout of the retail store for the shoppers. I’ve worked for a social media agency where I design how the user experience on social crosses over into their real world experience with the brand. There is a user experience built into everything we do, even when we don’t realize it!

          <h3>Why design is important to me</h3>
            <p>
              I love how design is a part of so many aspects of our lives and I appreciate really great design, not just visually but also in terms of how it improves our quality of life. Great design can also leave a lasting impression beyond the current trends that come and go.

          <h3>Design to make a difference</h3>
            <p>I hope that I can use my design skills to create meaningful products that people can seamlessly integrate into their everyday lives. It is important to me that I make products that leave a memorable and positive impact on the people who use them.
